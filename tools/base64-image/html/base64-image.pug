      ul.divider
        li Drag and drop image from your local system to the canvas above for converting to Base64.
        li Resulting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a> string will appear above once the image is loaded.
        li Base64 encoding is done as data:image/png for png images.
        li For all other image types such as .jpg, .ico, .svg, .gif, .bpm etc. encoding is done as data:image/jpeg.
        li It is recommended to convert only small size images to Base64 string.
        li Note that Internet Explorer 8 has a limit of 32 KB for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme">data URI</a>. Earlier versions have no support for it.
        li If you need to crop the image before converting then use the <a href="https://tools.superdevresources.com/image-cropper/">Image Cropper</a>.
        li We do not store any of your images as everything is done client side.
